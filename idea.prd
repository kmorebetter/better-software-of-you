# Software of You

**Core pitch:** "You're already paying for AI. Stop paying for everything else."

**Name rationale:** Signals personal, local, yours. The software that works for YOU, powered by YOUR AI subscription.

Modular platform that runs inside Claude Code as plugins/skills/commands. User's existing Claude subscription IS the runtime — no separate app, no API keys, no server. Modules produce local HTML dashboards and manage data via SQLite/files.

**Key messaging hook:** Every time Anthropic updates the Claude model, your apps get smarter automatically. You don't update anything. The intelligence layer improves for free.

**Target buyer:** Freelancers, solopreneurs, small agency operators, technical-leaning professionals fatigued by SaaS subscription stacking. Already using Claude Code or Claude Pro.

---

## How It Works

1. User buys the base platform (one-time $29-39)
2. Clones repo into their Claude Code environment
3. Modules register as Claude Code plugins/skills
4. User interacts via natural language commands in Claude Code
5. HTML dashboards generated locally for visual views
6. All data stored locally (SQLite/files) — no cloud, no sync

**Runtime = Claude Code.** No separate web app. No Next.js. No localhost server. The user's subscription powers everything directly, the way it's designed to work.

## Architecture

- **Base shell:** Claude Code plugin system — AGENTS.md, shared commands, data layer
- **Module system:** Each module is a Claude Code plugin (skills, commands, agents) that registers on install
- **Shared data layer (the moat):** Contacts, Projects, Notes/Activity, Tags — local SQLite or structured files that all modules read/write
- **Dashboard output:** Generated HTML files (like personal-os `dashboard.html`) opened in browser
- **Module loader:** Plugin discovery via Claude Code's native plugin system
- **Integration layer:** Modules that connect to external services (Gmail, Calendar, Stripe, Slack) use OAuth/API keys stored in local config. User authenticates once per service, module handles the rest. Everything runs in the terminal.

## V1 Scope

**Base:** Plugin framework + shared data layer + SQLite + core entities schema + dashboard generator

**Module 1 — Contacts/Client Manager:** CRUD, companies/individuals, notes timeline, tags, AI: summarize relationships, draft follow-ups

**Module 2 — Project Tracker:** Projects linked to contacts, task lists, timeline view, notes, AI: generate briefs, suggest next actions

Why these two: they naturally reference each other, proving the shared data thesis immediately.

## Module Roadmap (Post-V1)

**Data-only modules ($9-12):** Time tracker, invoice generator, content calendar, notes/wiki

**Integration modules ($15-19):** Gmail triage + drafting (OAuth), Google Calendar sync, Stripe invoicing, Slack/Discord summarizer, CRM enrichment (LinkedIn/Clearbit API), GitHub project sync

Integration modules are higher-value because they replace paid SaaS tools directly and require OAuth/API key setup that users don't want to figure out themselves.

## Revenue Model

- Base + 2 modules: $39
- Individual modules: $9-19
- Bundles: e.g., "Freelancer Pack" 4 modules for $49
- Expected LTV: $60-80, no churn
- Distribution: Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy

## Go-to-Market

1. Build V1 with two modules
2. Landing page with anti-SaaS positioning
3. Sell on Gumroad at $39
4. Seed in Indie Hackers, relevant subreddits, X/Twitter
5. Ship module 3 based on demand signal

**Positioning angles:**
- Primary: Anti-SaaS, own your tools, one-time purchase
- Secondary: Your AI subscription is underutilized — put it to work
- Tertiary: Your data stays on your machine, period

## Success Metrics (V1)

- 20+ paid customers in first 2 weeks
- Setup completion rate >80%
- 5+ customers asking "when's the next module?"
- Support requests per sale <0.3

## Technical Validation

> Updated 2026-02-17. Architecture corrected: this runs INSIDE Claude Code, not as a separate app.

### Why This Works

- **No TOS issue.** User runs Claude Code with their own subscription on their own machine. No third-party API routing. No harness. No bridge. This is the intended use case.
- **No extra cost.** Claude Pro/Max subscription IS the runtime. No API keys needed.
- **Plugin system is native.** Claude Code already supports plugins with skills, commands, agents, hooks. The module system maps directly to this.
- **Proven pattern.** personal-os already does this — Knowledge/ files, SQLite, generated HTML dashboards. This productizes the approach.

### Technical Approach

- Modules = Claude Code plugins (`.claude/plugins/` or standalone repos)
- Each module ships: skills (natural language commands), agents (specialized sub-agents), data schemas (SQLite migrations), dashboard templates (HTML generation scripts)
- Shared data via SQLite database that all modules read/write
- Dashboard generation via Python/Node scripts (like `scripts/build_dashboard.py`)
- Cross-module references via shared entity IDs (contact_id links projects to clients)

### Documentation & Accessibility

Non-technical users must be able to set this up. This is a hard constraint — if setup fails, there's no product.

**Requirements:**
- Step-by-step guides with screenshots for every module
- "Copy this command, paste it, hit enter" level of specificity
- Troubleshooting for common errors (permissions, missing dependencies, auth failures)
- Video walkthroughs for complex flows (OAuth setup, first-run, adding modules)
- The base system includes a `/help` or `/setup` command that walks the user through everything interactively inside Claude Code itself

**Key insight:** Claude Code IS the documentation layer. Users can ask "how do I add a contact?" and Claude answers in context, knowing what modules are installed. This is a massive advantage over traditional software docs.

### Packaging & Distribution

**DECIDED:** Gumroad zip delivery with Gumroad license keys.

- Base system ships as a single repo with 2 starter modules included
- Add-on modules are separate purchases, delivered as zip folders
- Each module is a folder the user drops into their project
- Base system detects new modules on next run
- `/install-module` command walks user through placement

**License key:** Gumroad generates keys automatically with every sale. One-time validation on first install via Gumroad API (~10 lines of code). Prevents casual sharing (forwarding the zip). Doesn't stop determined pirates — that's fine at this price point. The real lock-in is the relationship: new modules, updates, and support.

**Updates & upgrades:** Free. Buyer re-downloads the latest version from Gumroad (they get permanent access to the product page). Include a `/check-updates` command that tells the user if a newer version is available and links to the download.

**The auto-improvement hook:** Every time Anthropic updates the Claude model, the apps get smarter without any action from the user or us. The intelligence layer upgrades itself. This is unique positioning — no traditional SaaS can claim this.

**Pack structure:**
- **Base Pack ($39):** Core system + Contacts + Project Tracker
- **Freelancer Pack ($49):** Base + Time Tracker + Invoice Generator
- **Agency Pack ($69):** Everything + Gmail + Calendar + Slack modules
- Individual add-ons: $9-19 each

### Runtime Environments

Runs in:
- **Claude Code terminal (CLI)** — primary environment, full functionality
- **Claude Code Cloud/Desktop app** — same capabilities, browser-based, no local terminal needed. Broadens market to less technical users significantly.

### Module Dependency Model (Hybrid)

Two-layer architecture: **base owns the data, modules add intelligence — and modules can optionally enhance each other.**

**Layer 1: Base system owns core entities**

The base system ships with the shared data layer. These tables always exist:

| Entity | Fields (core) | Always available |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Contacts | name, email, company, phone, tags, notes, created, updated | Yes — basic CRUD via `/contact add`, `/contact list` |
| Projects | name, client_id, status, description, tags, created, updated | Yes — basic CRUD via `/project add`, `/project list` |
| Tags | name, color, category | Yes |
| Activity Log | entity_type, entity_id, action, details, timestamp | Yes — cross-module timeline |
| Notes | entity_type, entity_id, content, created | Yes |

This means: **any module works on day one** because the data it reads/writes is always there. No module is an island, and no module is a gatekeeper.

**Layer 2: Modules add intelligence + optional cross-module features**

Each module has two feature tiers:

- **Standalone features** — work with just the base data (always available)
- **Enhanced features** — activate when a complementary module is also installed

Examples:

| Module | Standalone | Enhanced (with other modules) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **CRM** | Relationship summaries, follow-up drafting, pipeline view, contact enrichment | + Project history per client (if Project Tracker installed) |
| **Project Tracker** | Task management, milestones, AI briefs, status tracking | + Client context on projects (if CRM installed), + Time totals (if Time Tracker installed) |
| **Time Tracker** | Log time, weekly reports, hourly breakdowns | + Time per project (if Project Tracker), + Billable hours per client (if CRM) |
| **Invoice Generator** | Create invoices, track payments | + Auto-populate from time logs (if Time Tracker), + Client billing details (if CRM) |
| **Gmail Module** | Email triage, draft responses, thread summaries | + Link emails to contacts (if CRM), + Email threads per project (if Project Tracker) |

**How detection works:**

Each module declares its enhancements in a manifest:

```yaml
# modules/time-tracker/manifest.yaml
name: time-tracker
version: 1.0
standalone: true
enhances_with:
  - module: project-tracker
    features: [time-per-project, project-time-reports]
  - module: crm
    features: [billable-hours-per-client]
```

On startup, the base system reads all installed module manifests, resolves which enhancements are active, and tells each module what's available. Modules check `is_module_installed("project-tracker")` before surfacing enhanced features.

**User experience:**

- User installs Time Tracker alone → works perfectly, logs time, generates reports
- User later adds Project Tracker → Time Tracker automatically surfaces "time per project" views
- No reconfiguration, no re-install — the enhancement activates because both modules see the shared data

**This is the "add a module and everything gets smarter" moment that makes it feel like a platform.**

### Handling Missing Modules

When a module references an enhancement that requires another module:

- **Never error.** The feature just doesn't appear.
- **Optionally surface a hint:** "You could see time breakdowns per project if you add the Project Tracker module." — gentle upsell, not a blocker.
- **Dashboard adapts:** Combined dashboard shows sections for installed modules only. Empty slots show "Available modules" with one-line descriptions.

### Open Technical Questions

- Schema migrations: how to handle shared DB schema evolution across independent module updates?
- Dashboard UX: single combined dashboard vs. per-module views vs. adaptive?
- Manifest format: YAML vs. JSON vs. something in the plugin.json Claude Code already uses?

---

## Risks

**Technical:** Cross-module schema coordination, plugin version compatibility, Claude Code plugin API stability (still evolving)

**Business:** Support burden at $29-39 price point, piracy/sharing of local code, market size capped by Claude Code adoption, dependency on Anthropic's plugin system remaining open

**Strategic open questions:** Open source base? Data portability format? Third-party module marketplace (v3)?

## Connection to Existing Ideas

This is the **productized version of personal-os** + the **platform evolution of Claude Code Skill Packs**:
- Skill packs (#1b) = individual modules sold standalone
- This platform = interconnected modules with shared data (dramatically more valuable)
- AI Concierge (#1) could use this as a client deliverable / case study
- personal-os is the proof of concept — you already live this
