## Why

The prompt engineering era taught us to talk to AI. But every conversation starts from zero — the AI knows nothing about your work, your relationships, your history. You are a stranger every time.

Context engineering is different. Instead of optimizing what you *say*, you build what your AI *knows* — a structured, cross-referenced representation of your professional world that makes every interaction smarter.

The problem is that your context is scattered across a dozen SaaS tools that don't talk to each other and don't talk to your AI. Your contacts are in one place, your emails in another, your conversations in a third, and your relationships — the actual texture of who you know and what you've built together — live nowhere at all.

Software of You brings it together. One place. On your machine. Compounding over time.

Every contact you add, every conversation you log, every email that syncs — each one makes every future question smarter. Not because the model improved. Because the context did.

You are not talking to AI. You are thinking with it.
