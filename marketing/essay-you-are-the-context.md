# You Are the Context

*The prompt engineering era taught us to talk to AI. The context engineering era is teaching us to think with AI.*

---

For the last few years, we've been learning to perform for machines.

We craft prompts. We iterate on phrasing. We discover that "think step by step" unlocks better reasoning, that "you are an expert in..." sharpens the output, that the right system message can turn a generic chatbot into something genuinely useful.

Prompt engineering works. But notice what it assumes: every conversation starts from zero. The AI knows nothing about you — your work, your relationships, your decisions, your history. You are a stranger every time you open a new chat.

So you compensate. You paste in background. You re-explain your company, your role, your client situation. You remind the AI what happened last week. You are doing the work of context — manually, repeatedly, incompletely.

This is prompt engineering's ceiling. You can perfect the question, but the machine still knows nothing about you before you ask it.

## What changes

Context engineering starts from a different premise. The question isn't "how do I phrase this to get a good answer?" It's "what does my AI already know about my world, so that *any* question gets a good answer?"

This is a structural shift, not a linguistic one. You stop optimizing individual prompts and start building a substrate — a persistent, structured, cross-referenced representation of your professional world that makes every AI interaction smarter.

And unlike prompt engineering, it compounds.

Every contact you track teaches the system who matters to you. Every conversation you log gives future-you the ability to ask "what did we agree on?" and get a real answer. Every email that syncs, every meeting that's recorded, every decision you capture — each one makes the next interaction more useful. Not because the model improved. Because the context did.

## The fragmentation problem

Here's why this matters now: your context is shattered across a dozen SaaS products.

Your contacts are in HubSpot. Your conversations are trapped in Zoom recordings nobody rewatches. Your decisions live in Slack threads that scroll off-screen in hours. Your email is in Gmail, your calendar in Google Calendar, your notes in Notion, your tasks in Asana. And your relationships — the actual texture of who you know, what you've built together, what you owe each other — live nowhere at all.

Each tool holds a fragment. None of them talk to each other. And critically, none of them talk to your AI.

So when you sit down with Claude and ask "should I follow up with Sarah?" — it has nothing. No relationship history. No conversation context. No knowledge of your shared projects or open commitments. It gives you a generic answer because it has generic context.

You're paying for twelve tools and still doing the context work yourself.

## Building instead of scattering

What if you stopped scattering your context and started building it?

Not across a dozen disconnected apps. In one place. Structured and cross-referenced. Living on your machine, under your control, accumulating over time.

You add a contact. Now the system knows who Sarah is, where she works, what your relationship looks like.

You log a conversation. Now it can extract commitments — what you owe her, what she owes you — and track whether they've been fulfilled.

You sync your email. Now it knows you've exchanged 14 messages this month, that the tone shifted after the pricing discussion, that she hasn't replied to your last message in six days.

You connect your calendar. Now it knows you're meeting her Thursday, and it can surface the relationship history, open commitments, and project context before you walk in.

None of this required a better prompt. It required better context.

## Compounding returns

The first week is modest. A few contacts, a few conversations logged. The AI knows a little about your world.

By month two, the cross-references start to matter. You ask about a project and see the client relationship alongside it. You ask about a person and see commitments they've made and whether they followed through. Patterns surface that you didn't ask for — because the connections were already there, waiting for a question.

By month six, your AI has a richer understanding of your professional world than any single tool ever could. Not because the model got smarter. Because you built the context that makes intelligence useful.

This is the difference between a tool you use and a system that thinks with you.

## Why it has to be local

Your context is intimate. It's your relationships. Your communication patterns. Your strategic thinking. Your vulnerabilities and strengths, reflected in how you talk and what you decide. It is, in a real sense, a model of you.

That model should not live on someone else's server. It should not be monetized, analyzed, or held hostage behind a recurring subscription. It should not disappear when a startup pivots or a service shuts down.

Your context should live on your machine. You should own it the way you own a journal — completely, privately, permanently. And it should get smarter every time the underlying AI model improves, without you paying more or migrating anything.

## The bet

The tools that define the next era of AI won't be the ones with the cleverest generation features. They'll be the ones that help you build the richest context over time.

Because intelligence without context is trivia. It's a parlor trick — impressive in the moment, useless by morning.

Intelligence *with* context is judgment. It's a system that knows what you know, remembers what you've decided, and can think alongside you about what comes next.

The prompt engineering era trained us to ask better questions.

The context engineering era rewards us for building better worlds.

You are not talking to AI. You are thinking with it. And the context — the structured, cross-referenced, compounding representation of your professional life — is you.
